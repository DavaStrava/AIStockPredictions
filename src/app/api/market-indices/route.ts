/**
 * MARKET INDICES API ROUTE - EDUCATIONAL OVERVIEW
 * 
 * This API route demonstrates several important software engineering patterns:
 * 
 * üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS:
 * - FALLBACK PATTERN: Graceful degradation when external APIs fail
 * - NESTED TRY-CATCH: Multi-level error handling for different failure scenarios
 * - DATA TRANSFORMATION: Converting external API format to internal format
 * - TIMEZONE HANDLING: Working with market hours across time zones
 * 
 * üõ°Ô∏è RESILIENCE PATTERNS:
 * - GRACEFUL DEGRADATION: App continues working even when external API fails
 * - MOCK DATA GENERATION: Realistic fallback data for development and demos
 * - ERROR ISOLATION: API failures don't crash the entire application
 * - DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING: Validate data before processing
 * 
 * üîß DUAL SYMBOL ARCHITECTURE:
 * - DISPLAY SYMBOLS: User-friendly names for UI components (e.g., "S&P 500", "NASDAQ")
 * - TECHNICAL SYMBOLS: API-compatible ticker symbols (e.g., "^GSPC", "^IXIC")
 * - SEPARATION OF CONCERNS: UI uses display symbols, APIs use technical symbols
 * - SINGLE RESPONSE: Both symbol types provided in same API response
 * 
 * üí° LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
 * - Understanding nested error handling strategies
 * - Working with external APIs and handling failures
 * - Date/time manipulation and timezone conversions
 * - Data transformation and mapping patterns
 * - Building resilient systems that handle real-world failures
 * - Implementing dual data formats for different use cases

/**
 * MARKET INDICES CONFIGURATION - STREAMLINED DATA STRUCTURE
 * 
 * This constant demonstrates the "configuration as data" pattern where we define
 * business logic (which indices to track) as structured data rather than code.
 * 
 * üîÑ RECENT API MIGRATION - FUTURES SYMBOL FORMAT CHANGE:
 * The futures symbols have been updated from Yahoo Finance format to Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) format.
 * This change demonstrates how configuration-driven architecture makes API migrations manageable.
 * 
 * üìä FUTURES SYMBOL FORMAT EVOLUTION:
 * - BEFORE: Yahoo Finance format (NQ=F, ES=F, YM=F, RTY=F)
 * - AFTER: FMP format (NQUSD, ESUSD, YMUSD, RTYUSD)
 * 
 * üîß WHY THE FORMAT CHANGED:
 * - API CONSISTENCY: Using single data provider (FMP) for both regular and futures data
 * - RELIABILITY: FMP provides more consistent futures data availability
 * - SIMPLIFICATION: Reduces complexity of managing multiple API endpoints
 * - COST OPTIMIZATION: Consolidating to one paid API service instead of mixing free/paid
 * 
 * üéØ DESIGN BENEFITS:
 * - MAINTAINABILITY: Easy to add/remove indices without code changes
 * - CONSISTENCY: Single source of truth for index information
 * - TYPE SAFETY: TypeScript can infer the structure and catch errors
 * - READABILITY: Clear, concise data structure without excessive documentation
 * - EXTENSIBILITY: New properties can be added without breaking existing code
 * - API FLEXIBILITY: Symbol format changes only require updating this configuration
 * 
 * üìä STREAMLINED DATA STRUCTURE EXPLANATION:
 * Each market index object contains four essential properties:
 * 
 * - symbol: The actual ticker symbol used by Financial Modeling Prep API for regular market data
 *   Examples: '^GSPC' (S&P 500), '^IXIC' (NASDAQ), '^DJI' (Dow Jones)
 *   The '^' prefix indicates these are index symbols, not individual stocks
 * 
 * - name: Human-readable name for display in the user interface
 *   Examples: 'S&P 500', 'NASDAQ', 'Dow Jones'
 *   These are the names users recognize and expect to see
 * 
 * - displaySymbol: Short name optimized for UI display in limited space
 *   Examples: 'S&P 500', 'NASDAQ', 'DOW', 'RUSSELL'
 *   Used in mobile layouts, charts, and compact displays
 * 
 * - futuresSymbol: Corresponding futures contract symbol for 24/7 price discovery
 *   Examples: 'ESUSD' (S&P 500 E-mini), 'NQUSD' (NASDAQ 100 E-mini)
 *   The 'USD' suffix indicates USD-denominated futures contracts in FMP format
 * 
 * üí° WHY SEPARATE SYMBOL AND DISPLAY NAMES:
 * - APIs often use technical symbols (^GSPC) that aren't user-friendly
 * - Display names (S&P 500) are more recognizable to users
 * - This mapping allows us to use correct API symbols while showing friendly names
 * - Enables internationalization (different display names for different languages)
 * 
 * üîÆ FUTURES SYMBOLS EXPLAINED - FMP API FORMAT:
 * Futures contracts are financial derivatives that trade nearly 24/7, providing
 * price discovery when stock markets are closed. The new FMP format uses different naming:
 * 
 * - NQUSD: NASDAQ 100 E-mini futures (tracks NASDAQ Composite movement)
 *   Contract size: $20 per point, trades on CME Globex
 *   FMP Format: Replaces Yahoo's NQ=F with NQUSD (USD-denominated)
 * 
 * - ESUSD: S&P 500 E-mini futures (tracks S&P 500 movement)
 *   Contract size: $50 per point, most liquid futures contract globally
 *   FMP Format: Replaces Yahoo's ES=F with ESUSD (USD-denominated)
 * 
 * - YMUSD: Dow Jones E-mini futures (tracks Dow Jones movement)
 *   Contract size: $5 per point, popular with retail traders
 *   FMP Format: Replaces Yahoo's YM=F with YMUSD (USD-denominated)
 * 
 * - RTYUSD: Russell 2000 E-mini futures (tracks Russell 2000 movement)
 *   Contract size: $50 per point, represents small-cap stocks
 *   FMP Format: Replaces Yahoo's RTY=F with RTYUSD (USD-denominated)
 * 
 * üîÑ SYMBOL FORMAT MIGRATION BENEFITS:
 * - UNIFIED API: All data (regular + futures) comes from single provider (FMP)
 * - CONSISTENCY: Same authentication, rate limits, and data quality standards
 * - RELIABILITY: Professional-grade API with better uptime guarantees
 * - SUPPORT: Dedicated customer support for troubleshooting data issues
 * 
 * üïê WHY FUTURES MATTER FOR MARKET ANALYSIS:
 * - EXTENDED HOURS: Trade when stock markets are closed (evenings, weekends)
 * - PRICE DISCOVERY: Indicate market sentiment and opening direction
 * - GLOBAL INFLUENCE: React to international news and events overnight
 * - LIQUIDITY: Provide continuous price information for analysis
 * - HEDGING: Allow institutional investors to manage risk 24/7
 * 
 * üîß ARRAY OF OBJECTS PATTERN:
 * This structure makes it easy to:
 * - Loop through indices: MARKET_INDICES.map(index => index.name)
 * - Find specific indices: MARKET_INDICES.find(index => index.symbol === '^GSPC')
 * - Extract symbols for API calls: MARKET_INDICES.map(index => index.symbol).join(',')
 * - Add new indices by simply adding objects to the array
 * - Access futures data conditionally: index.futuresSymbol
 * 
 * üìà PRACTICAL APPLICATION:
 * This structure enables the application to:
 * 1. Show regular market data during trading hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
 * 2. Switch to futures data when markets are closed (evenings, weekends)
 * 3. Provide continuous market insights 24/7
 * 4. Give users context about after-hours market movements
 * 5. Display appropriate names based on UI context (mobile vs desktop)
 * 
 * üèóÔ∏è CLEAN CODE PRINCIPLES DEMONSTRATED:
 * - CONCISENESS: Essential information without excessive documentation
 * - CLARITY: Each property has a clear, single purpose
 * - CONSISTENCY: All objects follow the same structure
 * - COMPLETENESS: Contains all data needed for the application
 * 
 * üí° LEARNING TAKEAWAY:
 * Good configuration design balances completeness with simplicity.
 * This structure provides all necessary functionality while remaining
 * easy to read, understand, and maintain. The key is including just
 * enough information to support current and anticipated future needs
 * without over-engineering the solution.

/**
 * üîÑ API MIGRATION AND CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES
 * 
 * The recent futures symbol format changes (NQ=F ‚Üí NQUSD, ES=F ‚Üí ESUSD, etc.) 
 * demonstrate several important software engineering principles and best practices:
 * 
 * üöÄ API MIGRATION STRATEGY - CONFIGURATION-DRIVEN APPROACH:
 * This change showcases how well-designed configuration makes API migrations manageable:
 * 
 * 1. üìç CENTRALIZED CONFIGURATION:
 *    - All API symbols defined in one place (this MARKET_INDICES array)
 *    - No scattered hardcoded symbols throughout the codebase
 *    - Single source of truth for all market data endpoints
 * 
 * 2. üîß ZERO-DOWNTIME MIGRATION:
 *    - Change symbols in configuration ‚Üí entire app uses new API format
 *    - No business logic changes required
 *    - Can test new format in development before production deployment
 * 
 * 3. üõ°Ô∏è RISK MITIGATION:
 *    - Easy rollback: revert configuration if new API has issues
 *    - Gradual migration possible: could migrate one symbol at a time
 *    - Type safety ensures all code uses correct symbol format
 * 
 * 4. üí∞ COST OPTIMIZATION:
 *    - Consolidating from multiple APIs (Yahoo + FMP) to single provider (FMP)
 *    - Reduces complexity of managing different rate limits and authentication
 *    - Professional API provides better reliability and support
 * 
 * üéØ REAL-WORLD API MIGRATION CHALLENGES THIS SOLVES:
 * - SYMBOL FORMAT DIFFERENCES: Yahoo uses 'ES=F', FMP uses 'ESUSD'
 * - AUTHENTICATION METHODS: Free APIs vs paid APIs with API keys
 * - RATE LIMITING: Different providers have different usage restrictions
 * - DATA QUALITY: Professional APIs often provide more accurate/timely data
 * - RELIABILITY: Paid services typically offer better uptime guarantees
 * 
 * The recent changes to the MARKET_INDICES configuration also demonstrate several
 * important software engineering principles and best practices:
 * 
 * 1. üìù DOCUMENTATION BALANCE:
 *    - BEFORE: Extensive inline documentation that could overwhelm the code
 *    - AFTER: Focused comments that explain the essential concepts
 *    - PRINCIPLE: Documentation should enhance understanding, not obscure the code
 *    - BENEFIT: Easier to read and maintain while preserving educational value
 * 
 * 2. üéØ CLARITY OVER VERBOSITY:
 *    - SIMPLIFIED NAMES: "Dow Jones Industrial Average" ‚Üí "Dow Jones"
 *    - FOCUSED COMMENTS: Essential information without excessive detail
 *    - CONSISTENT STRUCTURE: All objects follow the same commenting pattern
 *    - RESULT: Code that's easier to scan and understand at a glance
 * 
 * 3. üèóÔ∏è CONFIGURATION-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS:
 *    - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: All market index metadata lives in one place
 *    - EASY MAINTENANCE: Adding new indices requires only adding objects to the array
 *    - TYPE SAFETY: TypeScript infers the structure and catches usage errors
 *    - SCALABILITY: Can support hundreds of indices without architectural changes
 * 
 * 4. üîß PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS:
 *    This structure enables common programming operations:
 *    ```typescript
 *    // Extract all symbols for API calls
 *    const symbols = MARKET_INDICES.map(index => index.symbol).join(',');
 *    
 *    // Find specific index by symbol
 *    const sp500 = MARKET_INDICES.find(index => index.symbol === '^GSPC');
 *    
 *    // Get display names for UI
 *    const names = MARKET_INDICES.map(index => index.name);
 *    
 *    // Conditional symbol selection (regular vs futures)
 *    const activeSymbol = usefutures ? index.futuresSymbol : index.symbol;
 *    ```
 * 
 * 5. üí° BUSINESS DOMAIN INTEGRATION:
 *    - FINANCIAL CONCEPTS: Each index represents different market segments
 *    - TRADING HOURS: Futures symbols enable 24/7 price discovery
 *    - USER EXPERIENCE: Display names optimize for different UI contexts
 *    - TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: API symbols ensure correct data retrieval
 * 
 * 6. üöÄ EVOLUTIONARY DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
 *    - BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: Existing code continues to work unchanged
 *    - FORWARD COMPATIBILITY: New features can utilize the enhanced structure
 *    - ADDITIVE CHANGES: New properties added without removing existing ones
 *    - GRACEFUL DEGRADATION: System works even if some properties are missing
 * 
 * üéØ KEY LEARNING TAKEAWAYS:
 * 
 * - **Clean Code**: Simplicity and clarity are more valuable than comprehensive documentation
 * - **Maintainability**: Well-structured data is easier to modify and extend
 * - **Type Safety**: TypeScript helps catch errors when configurations change
 * - **Business Alignment**: Technical structure should reflect business requirements
 * - **Evolution**: Good design accommodates future needs without breaking existing functionality
 * 
 * üí° REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:
 * This pattern is commonly used in production systems for:
 * - API endpoint configurations and service discovery
 * - Feature flags and A/B testing parameters
 * - Internationalization and localization data
 * - Business rules and validation criteria
 * - Database connection strings and environment settings
 * 
 * üîÑ HOW THIS FUTURES SYMBOL CHANGE AFFECTS THE APPLICATION:
 * 
 * 1. üìä DATA FETCHING LOGIC:
 *    - When markets are closed, app automatically switches to futures data
 *    - Uses futuresSymbol from this configuration to fetch NQUSD instead of NQ=F
 *    - All downstream components receive data in same format regardless of source
 * 
 * 2. üé® USER INTERFACE:
 *    - UI components show "Futures Data" indicators when using futures symbols
 *    - Charts and displays work identically with new symbol format
 *    - No user-facing changes despite backend API migration
 * 
 * 3. üîç LOGGING AND DEBUGGING:
 *    - API calls now use ESUSD, NQUSD, etc. in request URLs
 *    - Error messages and logs reference new symbol format
 *    - Easier to trace issues with consistent API provider
 * 
 * 4. üíæ DATA STORAGE:
 *    - Database records may store symbol references for caching
 *    - New format ensures consistency between cached and live data
 *    - Historical data remains valid with proper symbol mapping
 * 
 * The key insight is that configuration should be data-driven rather than
 * code-driven, enabling changes without deployments and making the system
 * more flexible and maintainable over time. This futures symbol migration
 * perfectly demonstrates how good architecture pays dividends during inevitable
 * API changes and service migrations.

 * - INNER TRY-CATCH: Handles external API failures with fallback behavior
 * This allows different error scenarios to be handled appropriately

     * ENHANCED MARKET HOURS CALCULATION - COMPREHENSIVE TRADING SESSION DETECTION
     * 
     * This section demonstrates advanced timezone handling and financial market business logic.
     * The code has been enhanced from a simple "open/closed" check to a comprehensive
     * trading session detection system that recognizes all major market periods.
     * 
     * üïê TIMEZONE COMPLEXITY EXPLAINED:
     * - Users can be anywhere in the world (Tokyo, London, California, etc.)
     * - US stock markets operate on Eastern Time (EST/EDT with daylight saving)
     * - We need to determine exact market status regardless of user's location
     * - JavaScript Date objects are timezone-aware but require careful handling
     * 
     * üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION BREAKDOWN:
     * 1. new Date() gets current time in user's local timezone
     * 2. toLocaleString() converts to specific timezone (America/New_York)
     * 3. new Date() parses the converted string back to a Date object in Eastern Time
     * 4. getHours(), getMinutes(), getDay() extract the time components we need
     * 
     * üìÖ ENHANCED BUSINESS LOGIC - REAL MARKET TRADING SESSIONS:
     * This upgrade recognizes the actual complexity of modern stock trading:
     * - Regular Hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET (main trading session)
     * - Pre-Market: 4:00 AM - 9:30 AM ET (institutional and retail extended trading)
     * - After-Hours: 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM ET (earnings reactions, news-driven trading)
     * - Futures: Weekends and late nights (futures markets for indices)
     * - Market Closed: All other times when no trading occurs
     * 
     * üí° WHY THIS ENHANCED APPROACH MATTERS:
     * - ACCURACY: Users get precise information about what type of trading is happening
     * - CONTEXT: Different trading sessions have different characteristics and liquidity
     * - USER EXPERIENCE: More informative status helps users understand data relevance
     * - PROFESSIONAL GRADE: Matches the sophistication of real trading platforms
     * 
     * üéØ REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:
     * - Pre-market data might be less reliable due to lower volume
     * - After-hours trading often reacts to earnings announcements
     * - Weekend futures can indicate Monday opening direction
     * - Regular hours provide the most liquid and reliable price discovery

     * separate hour/minute comparisons. This pattern is commonly used in financial systems.
     * 
     * üî¢ MATHEMATICAL BREAKDOWN:
     * - hour * 100: Shifts hour to hundreds place (9 becomes 900, 14 becomes 1400)
     * - + minute: Adds minutes to ones/tens place (30 becomes 30, 5 becomes 5)
     * - Result: 9:30 AM becomes 930, 2:15 PM (14:15) becomes 1415
     * 
     * üéØ WHY THIS APPROACH IS SUPERIOR:
     * - SINGLE COMPARISON: 930 <= currentTime < 1600 vs (hour >= 9 && minute >= 30) && (hour < 16)
     * - EDGE CASE HANDLING: Automatically handles 9:29 vs 9:30 correctly
     * - READABILITY: Time ranges become simple integer comparisons
     * - PERFORMANCE: Integer comparison is faster than multiple boolean operations

       * üöÄ PRODUCTION DEBUGGING BEST PRACTICES DEMONSTRATED:
       * 
       * 1. **STRUCTURED LOGGING**: Use objects instead of strings for better parsing
       *    ‚úÖ Good: console.log('Data:', { symbol: 'AAPL', price: 150 })
       *    ‚ùå Bad: console.log('Symbol: AAPL, Price: 150')
       * 
       * 2. **FOCUSED EXTRACTION**: Only log the fields you need to debug
       *    ‚úÖ Good: .map(q => ({ symbol: q.symbol, name: q.name }))
       *    ‚ùå Bad: console.log(entireApiResponse) // Too much noise
       * 
       * 3. **DESCRIPTIVE PREFIXES**: Use consistent prefixes for easy filtering
       *    ‚úÖ Good: 'Market Indices - All received quotes:'
       *    ‚ùå Bad: 'Data:' or 'Debug:'
       * 
       * 4. **COMPARATIVE LOGGING**: Log both expected and actual data together
       *    This makes it easy to spot differences and identify root causes
       * 
       * 5. **TEMPORARY DEBUGGING**: These logs should be removed once the issue is resolved
       *    They're diagnostic tools, not permanent monitoring
       * 
       * üîß HOW TO USE THESE LOGS:
       * 1. Reproduce the issue (API call not working as expected)
       * 2. Check browser console or server logs for these debug messages
       * 3. Compare the two log outputs to identify mismatches
       * 4. Adjust configuration or API request based on findings
       * 5. Remove debug logs once issue is resolved
       * 
       * üí° LEARNING TAKEAWAY:
       * When APIs don't work as expected, the problem is usually in the details:
       * symbol formats, field names, data structure differences. Structured
       * logging like this helps you quickly identify and fix these issues.

          DEBUG LOGGING - EDUCATIONAL PATTERN FOR TROUBLESHOOTING
          
          This console.log demonstrates a crucial debugging technique for data transformation.
          When working with external APIs and complex fallback logic, logging the decision
          process helps developers understand what's happening at runtime.
          
          üîç LOGGING STRATEGY BREAKDOWN:
          - quoteSymbol: Shows what symbol the API returned (e.g., "^GSPC" or "ES=F")
          - quoteName: Shows the raw name from the API (e.g., "S&P 500" or "E-mini S&P 500 Futures")
          - hasIndexInfo: Boolean flag showing if we found matching configuration
          - finalName: Shows the actual name that will be displayed to users
          
          üí° WHY THIS LOGGING IS VALUABLE:
          1. DEBUGGING: Helps identify when fallback logic is triggered
          2. VALIDATION: Confirms our configuration matching is working correctly
          3. MONITORING: Can detect when APIs change their response format
          4. LEARNING: Shows the decision process for educational purposes
          
          üéØ PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS:
          In production, you might want to:
          - Use a proper logging library (Winston, Pino) instead of console.log
          - Add log levels (debug, info, warn, error) for better filtering
          - Include request IDs for tracing across multiple API calls
          - Consider performance impact of logging in high-traffic scenarios
          
          üîß BOOLEAN CONVERSION PATTERN:
          !!indexInfo converts any value to a strict boolean:
          - !! is the "double NOT" operator
          - First !: Converts to boolean and inverts (object becomes false, null becomes true)
          - Second !: Inverts again (object becomes true, null becomes false)
          - Result: Clean true/false instead of truthy/falsy values
          
          EXAMPLES:
          - !!{name: "S&P 500"} ‚Üí true (object exists)
          - !!null ‚Üí false (no matching configuration)

          DATA TRANSFORMATION WITH ENHANCED FALLBACK PATTERN
          
          This return object demonstrates advanced fallback strategies for handling
          inconsistent or missing data from external APIs. Each property uses the
          logical OR operator (||) to provide graceful degradation.
          
          üîß ENHANCED FALLBACK PATTERN EXPLANATION:
          The logical OR operator (||) evaluates from left to right and returns
          the first "truthy" value it encounters. This creates a priority chain
          where we prefer certain data sources over others.
          
          üí° RECENT SIMPLIFICATION - FROM TRIPLE TO SIMPLE CONDITIONAL:
          The 'name' property was simplified from a complex triple fallback to a simple conditional:
          
          BEFORE: indexInfo?.name || indexInfo?.displaySymbol || quote.name
          AFTER:  indexInfo ? indexInfo.name : quote.name
          
          üéØ RATIONALE FOR SIMPLIFICATION:
          The middle fallback (indexInfo?.displaySymbol) was removed because:
          1. Our MARKET_INDICES configuration always includes both name and displaySymbol
          2. displaySymbol is meant for UI space constraints, not as a name fallback
          3. The triple fallback created unnecessary complexity for this use case
          4. Simple conditional is more readable and maintainable
          
          CURRENT SIMPLIFIED FALLBACK STRATEGY:
          1. indexInfo.name (PREFERRED)
             - Our curated, user-friendly names from MARKET_INDICES config
             - Examples: "S&P 500", "NASDAQ", "Dow Jones", "Russell 2000"
             - Used when we have matching configuration for the symbol
             - Ensures consistent branding and user-friendly display names
          
          2. quote.name (FALLBACK)
             - Raw name from the external API (Financial Modeling Prep or Yahoo Finance)
             - Examples: "S&P 500", "NASDAQ Composite", "E-mini S&P 500 Futures"
             - Used when the symbol is not in our MARKET_INDICES configuration
             - Provides graceful degradation for unknown or new symbols
          
          üéØ WHY THIS SIMPLIFIED APPROACH WORKS BETTER:
          
          DESIGN PRINCIPLE:
          Since we control the MARKET_INDICES configuration and always include both
          name and displaySymbol for each index, the complex triple fallback was
          unnecessary. The simple conditional is more predictable and maintainable.
          
          EXAMPLE SCENARIOS WITH SIMPLIFIED LOGIC:
          
          Scenario A - Configured Index (Regular Hours):
          - indexInfo exists: { name: "S&P 500", symbol: "^GSPC", ... }
          - quote.name = "S&P 500" (from API)
          - Condition: indexInfo ? true
          - Result: "S&P 500" (uses indexInfo.name)
          
          Scenario B - Configured Index (Futures Hours):
          - indexInfo exists: { name: "S&P 500", futuresSymbol: "ES=F", ... }
          - quote.name = "E-mini S&P 500 Futures" (from futures API)
          - Condition: indexInfo ? true
          - Result: "S&P 500" (uses indexInfo.name, NOT the futures contract name)
          
          Scenario C - Unknown Symbol:
          - indexInfo = null (symbol not in MARKET_INDICES configuration)
          - quote.name = "Some Other Index" (from API)
          - Condition: indexInfo ? false
          - Result: "Some Other Index" (uses quote.name as fallback)
          
          üéì KEY LEARNING POINTS FROM THIS CODE EVOLUTION:
          
          1. SIMPLICITY OVER COMPLEXITY:
             - Start with defensive programming (triple fallback)
             - Simplify as requirements become clearer
             - Remove unnecessary complexity when it doesn't add value
          
          2. CONFIGURATION-DRIVEN DESIGN:
             - Well-structured configuration reduces the need for complex fallbacks
             - If you control the data structure, you can make stronger assumptions
             - Consistent configuration enables simpler, more predictable code
          
          3. CONDITIONAL VS LOGICAL OR PATTERNS:
             - Logical OR (||): Good for same-type fallbacks (string || string)
             - Ternary (?:): Better for different logic paths (object ? object.prop : fallback)
             - Choose the pattern that best expresses your intent
          
          4. CODE EVOLUTION PRINCIPLES:
             - Code should evolve toward clarity and maintainability
             - Complex defensive code can be simplified as understanding improves
             - Regular refactoring keeps code clean and understandable
             - Document the reasoning behind changes for future developers
          
          üèóÔ∏è SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES DEMONSTRATED:
          
          1. DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING:
             - Handles missing or inconsistent data gracefully
             - Prevents crashes when external APIs change their response format
             - Provides meaningful fallbacks instead of undefined values
          
          2. PRIORITY-BASED CONFIGURATION:
             - Our curated names take precedence over API names
             - Maintains consistent branding and user experience
             - Allows customization without modifying external data
          
          3. GRACEFUL DEGRADATION:
             - System continues working even with partial configuration
             - Users see reasonable names even when our config is incomplete
             - Better user experience than showing technical symbols or errors
          
          4. MAINTAINABILITY:
             - Easy to update display names by modifying MARKET_INDICES config
             - Changes don't require code modifications, just data updates
             - Clear priority order makes debugging easier
          
          üîç OPTIONAL CHAINING (?.) EXPLAINED:
          The ?. operator safely accesses properties that might not exist:
          - indexInfo?.name means "if indexInfo exists, access name property"
          - If indexInfo is null/undefined, the entire expression returns undefined
          - This prevents "Cannot read property 'name' of null" errors
          
          üöÄ PRODUCTION BENEFITS:
          - RELIABILITY: App works even when external APIs change
          - CONSISTENCY: Users see predictable, branded names
          - FLEXIBILITY: Easy to customize display without code changes
          - ROBUSTNESS: Handles edge cases and missing data gracefully
          
          üí° LEARNING TAKEAWAY:
          When working with external APIs, always implement fallback strategies.
          The triple fallback pattern (preferred || acceptable || lastResort)
          is a powerful technique for building resilient applications that
          handle real-world data inconsistencies gracefully.

            üîß PROBLEM THIS SOLVES:
            We need TWO different symbol formats for different purposes:
            1. USER-FRIENDLY SYMBOLS: For display in the UI (e.g., "S&P 500", "NASDAQ")
            2. TECHNICAL SYMBOLS: For API calls and data fetching (e.g., "^GSPC", "^IXIC")
            
            üéØ WHY WE NEED BOTH:
            
            DISPLAY SYMBOLS (stored in 'symbol' field):
            - Human-readable names that users recognize
            - Examples: "S&P 500", "NASDAQ", "DOW", "RUSSELL"
            - Used in UI components, charts titles, and user-facing displays
            - Optimized for readability and space constraints
            
            TICKER SYMBOLS (stored in 'tickerSymbol' field):
            - Technical symbols required by financial APIs
            - Examples: "^GSPC", "^IXIC", "^DJI", "^RUT"
            - Used for data fetching, chart APIs, and backend processing
            - Must match exact format expected by data providers
            
            üîÑ DATA FLOW EXAMPLE:
            
            1. CONFIGURATION PHASE:
               - MARKET_INDICES defines: { symbol: '^GSPC', displaySymbol: 'S&P 500' }
               - We store both the technical symbol and user-friendly name
            
            2. API RESPONSE BUILDING:
               - symbol: 'S&P 500' (for UI display)
               - tickerSymbol: '^GSPC' (for chart APIs)
               - Frontend receives both formats in the same response
            
            3. FRONTEND USAGE:
               - UI components use 'symbol' for display: "S&P 500"
               - Chart components use 'tickerSymbol' for data: "^GSPC"
               - No additional mapping or lookups required
            
            üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL BENEFITS:
            
            1. SEPARATION OF CONCERNS:
               - Display logic uses display-optimized symbols
               - Data fetching logic uses API-compatible symbols
               - Each system uses the format it needs without conversion
            
            2. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
               - No runtime symbol mapping or lookups required
               - Frontend receives both formats in single API call
               - Reduces complexity in chart components
            
            3. MAINTAINABILITY:
               - Symbol format changes only require config updates
               - No code changes needed when switching data providers
               - Clear distinction between display and technical symbols
            
            4. FLEXIBILITY:
               - Can customize display names without affecting data fetching
               - Easy to support multiple languages for display symbols
               - Technical symbols remain stable regardless of UI changes

            - Examples: "^GSPC", "^IXIC", "^DJI", "^RUT"
            - Ensures we use the correct symbols for our supported indices
            
            FALLBACK SOURCE (quote.symbol):
            - Symbol from the external API response
            - Used when we don't have the symbol in our configuration
            - Provides graceful degradation for unknown symbols
            
            üìä REAL-WORLD USE CASES:
            
            SCENARIO 1 - CHART COMPONENT NEEDS DATA:

            // Chart component receives market index data
            const chartData = await fetch(`/api/chart?symbol=${index.tickerSymbol}`);
            // Uses "^GSPC" for accurate S&P 500 chart data
            ```
            
            SCENARIO 2 - UI COMPONENT SHOWS NAME:
            ```jsx
            // UI component displays user-friendly name
            <h3>{index.symbol}</h3>
            // Shows "S&P 500" instead of "^GSPC"
            ```
            
            SCENARIO 3 - ANALYSIS API CALL:
            ```typescript
            // Technical analysis needs precise symbol
            const analysis = await fetch(`/api/analysis?symbol=${index.tickerSymbol}`);

            ```
            
            üöÄ PRODUCTION BENEFITS:
            
            1. USER EXPERIENCE:
               - Users see friendly names like "S&P 500" instead of "^GSPC"
               - Charts and analysis use correct technical symbols
               - No confusion between display and data symbols
            
            2. DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE:
               - Clear separation between display and data concerns
               - No need to remember symbol mappings in components
               - Both formats available in single API response
            
            3. SYSTEM RELIABILITY:
               - Correct symbols ensure accurate data fetching
               - Fallback pattern handles missing configuration gracefully
               - Reduces errors from symbol format mismatches
            
            üí° LEARNING TAKEAWAY:
            When building systems that interface with external APIs, it's common
            to need different data formats for different purposes. The dual symbol
            pattern (display + technical) is a clean way to handle this requirement
            without forcing components to do runtime conversions or lookups.
            
            This pattern is especially important in financial applications where
            symbol accuracy is critical for data integrity, but user experience
            requires human-readable names.

            ENHANCED NAME FALLBACK PATTERN - SIMPLIFIED CONDITIONAL LOGIC
            
            üîÑ CODE CHANGE EXPLANATION:
            BEFORE: indexInfo?.name || indexInfo?.displaySymbol || quote.name (triple fallback)
            AFTER:  indexInfo ? indexInfo.name : quote.name (simple conditional)
            
            üéØ WHY THIS CHANGE WAS MADE:
            The previous triple fallback was overly complex for this use case:
            - indexInfo?.name: Our curated name (e.g., "S&P 500")
            - indexInfo?.displaySymbol: Our display symbol (e.g., "NASDAQ") 
            - quote.name: API name (e.g., "NASDAQ Composite")
            
            The middle fallback (displaySymbol) was redundant because:
            1. If we have indexInfo, we ALWAYS have indexInfo.name configured
            2. displaySymbol is meant for UI display, not as a name fallback
            3. It created confusion between symbol and name concepts
            
            üîß TERNARY OPERATOR PATTERN:
            condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
            
            BREAKDOWN:
            - indexInfo: The condition (truthy if object exists, falsy if null/undefined)
            - indexInfo.name: Value used when indexInfo exists (our curated names)
            - quote.name: Value used when indexInfo doesn't exist (API fallback)
            
            üìä PRACTICAL EXAMPLES:
            
            SCENARIO 1 - REGULAR MARKET HOURS (indexInfo exists):
            - indexInfo = { name: "S&P 500", symbol: "^GSPC", ... }
            - quote.name = "S&P 500" (from API)
            - Result: "S&P 500" (uses indexInfo.name)
            
            SCENARIO 2 - FUTURES HOURS (indexInfo exists):
            - indexInfo = { name: "S&P 500", futuresSymbol: "ES=F", ... }
            - quote.name = "E-mini S&P 500 Futures" (from futures API)
            - Result: "S&P 500" (uses indexInfo.name, NOT the futures contract name)
            
            SCENARIO 3 - UNKNOWN SYMBOL (indexInfo is null):
            - indexInfo = null (symbol not in our MARKET_INDICES config)
            - quote.name = "Some Other Index" (from API)
            - Result: "Some Other Index" (uses quote.name as fallback)
            
            üèóÔ∏è SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES DEMONSTRATED:
            
            1. KISS PRINCIPLE (Keep It Simple, Stupid):
               - Simpler logic is easier to understand and maintain
               - Fewer conditions mean fewer potential bugs
               - More predictable behavior for developers
            
            2. SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY:
               - indexInfo.name: Human-readable names for display
               - indexInfo.displaySymbol: Short symbols for UI space constraints
               - quote.name: API-provided names as fallback
               - Each property has a clear, distinct purpose
            
            3. DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING:
               - Still handles the case where indexInfo doesn't exist
               - Graceful fallback to API data when our config is incomplete
               - Prevents undefined/null name values that could break UI
            
            üé® USER EXPERIENCE BENEFITS:
            - CONSISTENCY: Users always see "S&P 500", never "E-mini S&P 500 Futures"
            - CLARITY: Clean, recognizable names instead of technical contract names
            - BRANDING: Our curated names match what users expect to see
            - RELIABILITY: Fallback ensures something is always displayed
            
            üí° BOOLEAN EVALUATION IN JAVASCRIPT:
            Objects are "truthy" in JavaScript, so:
            - indexInfo (when it's an object): truthy ‚Üí use indexInfo.name
            - indexInfo (when it's null/undefined): falsy ‚Üí use quote.name
            
            This is more reliable than checking indexInfo?.name because:
            - We control the MARKET_INDICES configuration
            - If indexInfo exists, indexInfo.name is guaranteed to exist
            - No need to check for the property's existence separately
            
            üîÑ REFACTORING BENEFITS:
            - READABILITY: Intent is clearer with simple conditional
            - MAINTAINABILITY: Easier to modify or extend the logic
            - PERFORMANCE: One less property access and comparison
            - DEBUGGING: Simpler logic means easier troubleshooting
            
            This change demonstrates how code evolution often moves toward
            simplicity as requirements become clearer and edge cases are
            better understood. The original triple fallback was defensive
            programming, but experience showed the middle case was unnecessary.

       * MOCK DATA GENERATION - REALISTIC SIMULATION PATTERN
       * 
       * This section demonstrates how to generate realistic mock data that
       * maintains the user experience when real data isn't available.
       * 
       * üéØ MOCK DATA DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
       * - REALISTIC VALUES: Use approximate real-world values for believability
       * - DYNAMIC VARIATION: Add randomness so data changes between requests
       * - CONSISTENT STRUCTURE: Match the exact format of real API responses
       * - BUSINESS LOGIC: Apply the same processing as real data
       * 
       * üî¢ MATHEMATICAL PATTERNS USED:
       * 
       * ARRAY INDEXING FOR BASE VALUES:
       * - [15000, 4500, 35000, 2000][i] uses array index to get different base prices
       * - i comes from map((index, i) => ...) - the second parameter is the array index
       * - This ensures NASDAQ gets ~15000, S&P 500 gets ~4500, etc.
       * - Approximates real market index levels for believability
       * 
       * RANDOM PERCENTAGE CALCULATION:
       * - Math.random() returns 0.0 to 1.0
       * - Math.random() - 0.5 returns -0.5 to 0.5 (centered around 0)
       * - (Math.random() - 0.5) * 4 returns -2.0 to 2.0
       * - This simulates realistic daily market movements (-2% to +2%)
       * 
       * PERCENTAGE TO DOLLAR CONVERSION:
       * - change = (basePrice * changePercent) / 100
       * - If basePrice is 4500 and changePercent is 1.5, change = 67.5
       * - This converts percentage change to actual dollar change
       * 
       * PRECISION ROUNDING:
       * - Math.round(value * 100) / 100 rounds to 2 decimal places
       * - Multiply by 100: 4567.123 ‚Üí 456712.3
       * - Round: 456712.3 ‚Üí 456712
       * - Divide by 100: 456712 ‚Üí 4567.12
       * - This ensures prices look realistic (no excessive decimal places)
