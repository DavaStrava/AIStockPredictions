/**
 * DATABASE CONNECTION MODULE - Production-Ready PostgreSQL Connection Management
 * 
 * This module demonstrates several critical patterns for building robust database
 * connections in production applications, especially in serverless environments
 * like AWS Lambda where connection management is crucial for performance and cost.
 * 
 * üèóÔ∏è KEY ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED:
 * 
 * 1. CONNECTION POOLING PATTERN:
 *    - Uses PostgreSQL connection pools to reuse database connections
 *    - Prevents connection exhaustion and improves performance
 *    - Essential for serverless functions that may scale rapidly
 * 
 * 2. SINGLETON PATTERN:
 *    - Single database instance shared across Lambda invocations
 *    - Reduces connection overhead and improves cold start performance
 *    - Critical for cost optimization in serverless environments
 * 
 * 3. SECRETS MANAGEMENT PATTERN:
 *    - Integrates with AWS Secrets Manager for secure credential storage
 *    - Supports both cloud (Secrets Manager) and local development modes
 *    - Follows 12-factor app principles for configuration management
 * 
 * 4. GRACEFUL DEGRADATION:
 *    - Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages
 *    - Health check capabilities for monitoring and alerting
 *    - Transaction support with automatic rollback on failures
 * 
 * üí° LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
 * - Understanding connection pooling and why it matters
 * - Learning AWS Secrets Manager integration patterns
 * - Seeing how to build production-ready database abstractions
 * - Understanding transaction management and error handling
 * 
 * This code serves as a template for any production application requiring
 * reliable, scalable database connectivity with proper security practices.

   * 
   * üöÄ LAZY INITIALIZATION BENEFITS:
   * 
   * 1. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
   *    - Connection pool is only created when first database operation occurs
   *    - Reduces cold start time for Lambda functions
   *    - Saves resources if database isn't used in a particular execution
   * 
   * 2. ERROR ISOLATION:
   *    - Database connection errors only occur when database is actually needed
   *    - Application can start successfully even if database is temporarily unavailable
   *    - Allows for graceful degradation in microservice architectures
   * 
   * 3. SINGLETON BEHAVIOR:
   *    - Once created, the same pool instance is reused across all operations
   *    - Prevents multiple pool creation in concurrent scenarios
   *    - Maintains connection efficiency across Lambda invocations
   * 
   * üí° WHY THIS PATTERN MATTERS:
   * In serverless environments, every millisecond of cold start time matters.
   * By deferring pool creation until needed, we optimize for the common case
   * where the function starts quickly and only pays the connection cost when
   * actually performing database operations.

   * 
   * üéØ AUTOMATIC RESOURCE MANAGEMENT BENEFITS:
   * 
   * 1. LEAK PREVENTION:
   *    - Connections are automatically returned to the pool
   *    - No risk of forgetting to call client.release()
   *    - Prevents connection pool exhaustion
   * 
   * 2. ERROR SAFETY:
   *    - Connections are released even if queries fail
   *    - Proper error logging for debugging
   *    - Clean error propagation to calling code
   * 
   * 3. SIMPLICITY:
   *    - One-line database queries without boilerplate
   *    - Consistent interface for all simple operations
   *    - Reduces code duplication across the application
   *

   * @param params - Optional array of parameters for the query
   * @returns Promise<any> - Query result object with rows, rowCount, etc.

  /**
   * Execute Database Transaction - ACID Transaction Pattern
   * 
   * This method implements the DATABASE TRANSACTION PATTERN, which is crucial

   * need to succeed or fail together.
   * 
   * üîí ACID TRANSACTION PROPERTIES:
   * 
   * 1. ATOMICITY:
   *    - All operations in the transaction succeed, or all are rolled back
   *    - No partial updates that could leave data in an inconsistent state
   *    - Essential for financial applications where data integrity is critical
   * 
   * 2. CONSISTENCY:
   *    - Database constraints are enforced throughout the transaction
   *    - Foreign key relationships remain valid
   *    - Business rules are maintained
   * 
   * 3. ISOLATION:
   *    - Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other
   *    - Each transaction sees a consistent view of the data
   *    - Prevents race conditions and data corruption
   * 
   * 4. DURABILITY:
   *    - Once committed, changes are permanently stored
   *    - Survives system crashes and power failures
   *    - Guaranteed by the database engine
   * 
   * üéØ TRANSACTION LIFECYCLE:
   * 1. BEGIN - Start the transaction
   * 2. Execute operations via callback function
   * 3. COMMIT - Make changes permanent (if successful)
   * 4. ROLLBACK - Undo all changes (if any operation fails)
   * 5. Release connection back to pool
   * 
   * üí° WHEN TO USE TRANSACTIONS:
   * - Creating related records (user + profile + preferences)
   * - Financial operations (debit one account, credit another)
   * - Batch updates that must be consistent
   * - Any operation where partial success would be problematic
   * 
   * @param callback - Function that performs database operations within the transaction
   * @returns Promise<T> - The result returned by the callback function
   * @throws {Error} When any operation in the transaction fails
   * 
   * @example
   * ```typescript

   * Close Connection Pool - Resource Cleanup Pattern
   * 
   * This method implements the RESOURCE CLEANUP PATTERN, which is essential
   * for preventing resource leaks and ensuring graceful application shutdown.
   * 
   * üßπ CLEANUP RESPONSIBILITIES:
   * 
   * 1. CONNECTION TERMINATION:
   *    - Closes all active connections in the pool
   *    - Waits for in-flight queries to complete
   *    - Prevents new connections from being created
   * 
   * 2. MEMORY CLEANUP:
   *    - Sets pool reference to null to enable garbage collection
   *    - Frees up memory used by connection objects
   *    - Cleans up event listeners and timers
   * 
   * 3. GRACEFUL SHUTDOWN:
   *    - Allows existing operations to complete
   *    - Prevents new operations from starting
   *    - Provides clean application termination
   * 
   * üí° WHEN TO CALL THIS METHOD:
   * - Application shutdown (process.on('SIGTERM'))
   * - Test cleanup (afterAll hooks)
   * - Lambda function cleanup (rare, but possible)
   * - Error recovery scenarios
   * 
   * ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: After calling close(), you cannot use this connection
   * instance anymore. Create a new instance if you need database access again.
   * 
   * @returns Promise<void> - Resolves when all connections are closed

  /**
   * Database Health Check - Monitoring and Observability Pattern
   * 
   * This method implements the HEALTH CHECK PATTERN, which is crucial for
   * monitoring system health and enabling automated recovery in production
   * environments.
   * 
   * üè• HEALTH CHECK BENEFITS:
   * 
   * 1. EARLY PROBLEM DETECTION:
   *    - Identifies database connectivity issues before they affect users
   *    - Enables proactive alerting and intervention
   *    - Helps distinguish between application and database problems
   * 
   * 2. LOAD BALANCER INTEGRATION:
   *    - Load balancers can remove unhealthy instances from rotation
   *    - Prevents routing traffic to instances with database problems
   *    - Enables automatic failover to healthy instances
   * 
   * 3. MONITORING INTEGRATION:
   *    - CloudWatch and other monitoring systems can track health status
   *    - Enables automated scaling based on health metrics
   *    - Provides data for capacity planning and performance optimization
   * 
   * 4. DEBUGGING ASSISTANCE:
   *    - Simple test to verify basic database functionality
   *    - Helps isolate network vs. database vs. application issues
   *    - Provides immediate feedback during deployment
   * 
   * üí° HEALTH CHECK DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
   * - Fast: Should complete quickly to avoid timeout issues
   * - Simple: Uses minimal database resources
   * - Safe: Read-only operation that doesn't modify data
   * - Reliable: Consistent behavior across different database states
   * 
   * @returns Promise<boolean> - true if database is healthy, false otherwise
   * 
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * // Use in API health endpoint
   * app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
   *   const isHealthy = await db.healthCheck();
   *   res.status(isHealthy ? 200 : 503).json({
   *     status: isHealthy ? 'healthy' : 'unhealthy',
   *     timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
   *   });
   * });
   * ```
   */

      const result = await this.query('SELECT 1 as health_check');
      
      // VALIDATE RESPONSE
      // Ensure we got the expected result structure and value
      // This confirms not just connectivity but basic query processing
      return result.rows.length > 0 && result.rows[0].health_check === 1;
    } catch (error) {
      // ERROR LOGGING
      // Log the specific error for debugging purposes
      // This helps diagnose whether the issue is network, authentication, etc.
      console.error('Database health check failed:', error);

/**
 * SINGLETON PATTERN IMPLEMENTATION FOR SERVERLESS ENVIRONMENTS
 * 
 * This section demonstrates the SINGLETON PATTERN, which is particularly
 * important in serverless environments like AWS Lambda where you want to
 * reuse expensive resources across function invocations.
 * 
 * üöÄ SERVERLESS OPTIMIZATION BENEFITS:
 * 
 * 1. CONNECTION REUSE:
 *    - Database connections persist across Lambda invocations
 *    - Dramatically reduces cold start time for subsequent requests
 *    - Saves money by reducing connection establishment overhead
 * 
 * 2. MEMORY EFFICIENCY:
 *    - Single connection pool shared across all operations
 *    - Prevents multiple pool creation in concurrent scenarios
 *    - Optimizes Lambda memory usage
 * 
 * 3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
 *    - First request pays connection cost, subsequent requests are fast
 *    - Connection pools maintain warm connections ready for use
 *    - Reduces latency for database operations
 * 
 * üí° WHY SINGLETON IN SERVERLESS:
 * Lambda containers can be reused across invocations. By using a singleton
 * pattern, we ensure that expensive database connections are established
 * once and reused, rather than recreated for every function invocation.
 * 
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This singleton is per Lambda container, not global across
 * all Lambda instances. Each container gets its own database connection.

/**
 * Get Database Connection Instance - Singleton Factory Pattern
 * 
 * This function implements the SINGLETON FACTORY PATTERN, providing a
 * single point of access to the database connection while ensuring
 * only one instance exists per Lambda container.
 * 
 * üè≠ FACTORY PATTERN BENEFITS:
 * - Encapsulates object creation logic
 * - Provides consistent initialization across the application
 * - Allows for different configuration strategies
 * - Makes testing easier with dependency injection
 * 
 * üîÑ SINGLETON BEHAVIOR:
 * - First call creates and configures the instance
 * - Subsequent calls return the existing instance
 * - Configuration is only applied on first creation
 * 
 * @param config - Optional configuration (only used on first call)
 * @returns DatabaseConnection - The singleton database connection instance
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // First call creates the instance
 * const db1 = getDatabase({ maxConnections: 5 });
 * 
 * // Subsequent calls return the same instance
 * const db2 = getDatabase(); // Same instance as db1
 * console.log(db1 === db2); // true
 * ```
