/**
 * Financial Terms Knowledge Base - Educational Definitions System
 * 
 * This module provides a comprehensive knowledge base of financial and technical analysis terms
 * used throughout the stock prediction platform. It demonstrates several important software
 * engineering patterns and TypeScript concepts for building maintainable knowledge systems.
 * 
 * Key Concepts Demonstrated:
 * - TypeScript interfaces for type safety and documentation
 * - Union types for controlled vocabularies
 * - Optional properties with the ? operator
 * - Const assertions for immutable data structures
 * - Helper functions for data access and search
 * - Separation of data from presentation logic

/**
 * TermDefinition Interface - Structured Financial Knowledge
 * 
 * This interface defines the complete structure for financial term definitions.
 * It demonstrates several TypeScript and software design concepts:
 * 
 * 1. COMPREHENSIVE DATA MODELING: Each term includes multiple aspects
 *    (definition, formula, interpretation, examples) for complete understanding
 * 
 * 2. UNION TYPES: The 'category' field uses a union type to restrict values
 *    to only valid categories, preventing typos and ensuring consistency
 * 
 * 3. OPTIONAL PROPERTIES: The 'formula?' field is optional since not all
 *    financial terms have mathematical formulas (e.g., general concepts)
 * 
 * 4. EDUCATIONAL STRUCTURE: Fields are organized to support progressive
 *    learning from basic definition to advanced trading applications
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const rsiDefinition: TermDefinition = {
 *   term: 'RSI',
 *   category: 'technical',
 *   shortDefinition: 'Momentum oscillator...',
 *   // ... other required fields
 * };
 * ```
 */

  category: 'technical' | 'portfolio' | 'fundamental' | 'general'; // Union type for categorization
  shortDefinition: string;         // Brief one-line explanation
  detailedDefinition: string;      // Comprehensive explanation of the concept
  formula?: string;                // Optional mathematical formula (not all terms have formulas)
  interpretation: string;          // How to read and understand the values
  tradingSignals: string;          // Practical trading applications and signals
  example: string;                 // Real-world example with specific numbers
  relatedTerms: string[];          // Array of related terms for cross-referencing
  icon: string;                    // Emoji icon for visual identification

/**
 * FINANCIAL_TERMS - Comprehensive Knowledge Database
 * 
 * This constant demonstrates several important programming patterns:
 * 
 * 1. RECORD TYPE: Uses TypeScript's Record<string, TermDefinition> type
 *    - Creates a dictionary/map structure with string keys and TermDefinition values
 *    - Provides type safety for both keys and values
 *    - Enables efficient O(1) lookup by term name
 * 
 * 2. CONST ASSERTION: The 'const' keyword makes this immutable
 *    - Prevents accidental modification of the knowledge base
 *    - Enables TypeScript to infer more specific types
 *    - Supports tree-shaking in bundlers for smaller builds
 * 
 * 3. STRUCTURED DATA ORGANIZATION: Terms are grouped by category with comments
 *    - Makes the code more maintainable and easier to navigate
 *    - Supports future expansion with new categories
 *    - Enables bulk operations on categories
 * 
 * 4. COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE: Each term includes all educational aspects
 *    - Supports different learning styles (visual, mathematical, practical)
 *    - Enables progressive disclosure in the UI
 *    - Provides context for AI-powered explanations
 * 
 * Data Structure Benefits:
 * - Fast lookups: O(1) access time by key
 * - Type safety: Compile-time checking of all term data
 * - Maintainability: Clear structure for adding new terms
 * - Extensibility: Easy to add new fields or categories

 *    - Enables TypeScript to infer literal types instead of general string types
 *    - Prevents accidental mutations that could break the UI
 *    - Example: 'blue' is inferred as literal 'blue', not generic string
 * 
 * 2. CONFIGURATION OBJECT PATTERN:
 *    - Centralizes UI-related metadata for each category
 *    - Separates presentation concerns from data structure
 *    - Makes it easy to change colors/icons without touching term definitions
 *    - Supports consistent theming across the application
 * 
 * 3. STRUCTURED METADATA:
 *    - label: Human-readable display name for UI
 *    - color: Consistent color scheme for visual categorization
 *    - icon: Visual identifier for quick recognition
 * 
 * 4. TYPE SAFETY BENEFITS:
 *    - TypeScript can validate that only valid categories are used
 *    - Autocomplete works for category properties
 *    - Compile-time errors if categories are mistyped

/**
 * Get Term Definition - Smart Lookup Function
 * 
 * This function demonstrates several important programming concepts:
 * 
 * 1. DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING:
 *    - Returns undefined instead of throwing errors for missing terms
 *    - Handles edge cases gracefully (null, undefined, empty strings)
 *    - Provides fallback behavior for better user experience
 * 
 * 2. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
 *    - Tries exact match first (O(1) hash table lookup)
 *    - Falls back to slower search only if needed
 *    - Avoids unnecessary computation for common cases
 * 
 * 3. FLEXIBLE MATCHING:
 *    - Supports exact key matches ("RSI")
 *    - Supports case-insensitive matching ("rsi", "Rsi")
 *    - Supports partial matches in term names ("Relative Strength")
 * 
 * 4. EARLY RETURN PATTERN:
 *    - Returns immediately when exact match is found
 *    - Avoids unnecessary processing
 *    - Makes code more readable and efficient
 * 
 * @param term - The term to look up (case-insensitive)
 * @returns TermDefinition if found, undefined if not found
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const rsi = getTermDefinition('RSI');        // Exact match
 * const rsi2 = getTermDefinition('rsi');       // Case-insensitive
 * const rsi3 = getTermDefinition('Relative');  // Partial match

  // STEP 3: Try case-insensitive and partial matching (slower - O(n) iteration)
  // Only executed if exact match fails, preserving performance for common cases
  const lowerTerm = term.toLowerCase();
  
  // Object.entries() converts the Record to an array of [key, value] pairs
  // This allows us to iterate through both keys and values simultaneously

/**
 * Search Terms - Full-Text Search Function
 * 
 * This function demonstrates advanced search patterns and functional programming:
 * 
 * 1. FULL-TEXT SEARCH:
 *    - Searches across multiple fields (term, definition, category)
 *    - Provides comprehensive results for user queries
 *    - Supports discovery of related concepts
 * 
 * 2. FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING PATTERNS:
 *    - Uses Object.values() to extract all term definitions
 *    - Uses Array.filter() for declarative filtering
 *    - Chains operations for readable, maintainable code
 * 
 * 3. CASE-INSENSITIVE SEARCH:
 *    - Normalizes both query and data to lowercase
 *    - Provides better user experience (no need to match exact case)
 *    - Handles various input styles consistently
 * 
 * 4. MULTI-FIELD MATCHING:
 *    - Searches term names, definitions, and categories
 *    - Increases likelihood of finding relevant results
 *    - Supports different search strategies (exact term vs. concept)
 * 
 * Performance Considerations:
 * - O(n) time complexity where n is number of terms
 * - Could be optimized with search indexing for larger datasets
 * - Currently efficient enough for the expected term count (~50-100 terms)
 * 
 * @param query - Search query string
 * @returns Array of matching TermDefinition objects
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const results = searchTerms('momentum');     // Finds RSI, MACD, Stochastic
 * const results2 = searchTerms('overbought'); // Finds RSI, Stochastic, Williams %R
 * ```

/**
 * Get Terms by Category - Type-Safe Category Filtering
 * 
 * This function demonstrates advanced TypeScript type safety patterns:
 * 
 * 1. KEYOF OPERATOR:
 *    - 'keyof typeof TERM_CATEGORIES' creates a union type of valid category keys
 *    - Ensures only valid categories can be passed ('technical' | 'portfolio' | 'fundamental' | 'general')
 *    - Provides compile-time error checking and IDE autocomplete
 *    - Prevents runtime errors from invalid category names
 * 
 * 2. TYPE INFERENCE:
 *    - TypeScript infers the return type as TermDefinition[]
 *    - The filter operation maintains type safety throughout
 *    - No need for explicit type annotations
 * 
 * 3. FUNCTIONAL FILTERING:
 *    - Uses Array.filter() for declarative programming style
 *    - More readable than imperative for loops
 *    - Easily composable with other array operations
 * 
 * 4. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
 *    - O(n) time complexity for filtering
 *    - Could be optimized with pre-computed category indexes
 *    - Acceptable performance for expected data size
 * 
 * Usage in UI Components:
 * ```typescript
 * const technicalTerms = getTermsByCategory('technical');
 * const portfolioTerms = getTermsByCategory('portfolio');
 * // TypeScript error: getTermsByCategory('invalid'); // Compile-time error!

 * This simple function demonstrates several important concepts:
 * 
 * 1. COMPLETE DATA ACCESS:
 *    - Provides access to the entire knowledge base
 *    - Useful for operations that need all terms (statistics, exports, etc.)
 *    - Supports bulk operations and analysis
 * 
 * 2. OBJECT.VALUES() PATTERN:
 *    - Extracts all values from the Record<string, TermDefinition>
 *    - Converts the dictionary/map structure to an array
 *    - Enables array operations (map, filter, reduce, etc.)
 * 
 * 3. FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING ENABLER:
 *    - Returns an array that can be chained with other operations
 *    - Supports functional programming patterns throughout the application
 *    - Example: getAllTerms().filter(...).map(...).reduce(...)
 * 
 * 4. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
 *    - Creates a new array each time (not cached)
 *    - For frequent access, consider memoization
 *    - Current approach is simple and sufficient for expected usage
 * 
 * Common Use Cases:
 * - Displaying all terms in a glossary
 * - Generating statistics about the knowledge base
 * - Exporting term data for external use
 * - Bulk operations across all terms
 * 
 * @returns Array containing all term definitions
 * 
 * @example

 *    - Progressive disclosure of complexity
 * 
 * 5. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
 *    - O(1) hash table lookups for exact matches
 *    - O(n) linear search as fallback
 *    - Early returns to avoid unnecessary computation
 *    - Consideration of caching strategies
 * 
 * 6. USER EXPERIENCE PATTERNS:
 *    - Case-insensitive search for better usability
 *    - Partial matching for discovery
 *    - Multi-field search for comprehensive results
 *    - Visual categorization with icons and colors
 * 
 * 7. MAINTAINABILITY FEATURES:
 *    - Clear separation of concerns
 *    - Comprehensive documentation
 *    - Extensible data structure
 *    - Type safety preventing runtime errors
 * 
 * This module serves as an excellent example of how to build a robust,
 * type-safe, and user-friendly knowledge management system in TypeScript.
 * The patterns demonstrated here can be applied to many other domains
 * beyond financial terminology.
