# Test Additions Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive unit tests for the market context inference functionality in the technical analysis explanations module.

## Code Changes Analyzed
The recent changes to `src/components/StockDashboard.tsx` added two imports:
- `TechnicalIndicatorExplanations` component
- `inferMarketContext` function from `@/lib/technical-analysis/explanations`

**Note:** These imports were added but not yet used in the component. No new functionality was implemented in StockDashboard.tsx.

## Tests Added

### File: `src/lib/technical-analysis/__tests__/explanations.test.ts`

Added 28 new test cases covering the following functionality:

### 1. Market Context Inference (`inferMarketContext`)
- ✅ Infers market context with all parameters (sector, market cap, price data)
- ✅ Handles missing optional parameters gracefully
- ✅ Correctly categorizes market cap (small < $2B, mid $2B-$10B, large > $10B)
- ✅ Handles insufficient price data by defaulting to sideways/medium
- ✅ Uses sector parameter when provided

### 2. Market Condition Determination (`determineMarketCondition`)
- ✅ Identifies bull market conditions (price above MAs, 20-day MA > 50-day MA)
- ✅ Identifies bear market conditions (price below MAs, 20-day MA < 50-day MA)
- ✅ Identifies sideways market conditions (mixed signals)
- ✅ Returns sideways for insufficient data (< 20 data points)
- ✅ Handles edge cases where price equals moving averages

### 3. Volatility Calculation (`calculateVolatility`)
- ✅ Identifies low volatility (annualized < 15%)
- ✅ Identifies high volatility (annualized > 30%)
- ✅ Identifies medium volatility (15-30% annualized)
- ✅ Returns medium for insufficient data
- ✅ Handles zero volatility (flat prices)

### 4. Sector Insights (`getSectorInsights`)
- ✅ Returns insights for Technology sector
- ✅ Returns insights for Healthcare sector
- ✅ Returns insights for Financial sector
- ✅ Returns insights for Energy sector
- ✅ Returns insights for Consumer sector
- ✅ Returns insights for Industrial sector
- ✅ Handles unknown sectors gracefully
- ✅ Handles case-insensitive sector matching
- ✅ Handles partial sector name matching

### 5. Market Context Application in Explanations
- ✅ Applies bull market context to RSI explanations
- ✅ Applies bear market context to MACD explanations
- ✅ Applies sideways market context appropriately
- ✅ Works without market context (graceful degradation)

## Test Coverage Improvements

### Before
- Basic explanation generation for technical indicators
- Signal conflict detection
- Overall sentiment determination

### After
- **Complete coverage** of market context inference logic
- **Edge case handling** for insufficient data
- **Boundary testing** for market cap categorization
- **Integration testing** of context application in explanations
- **Volatility calculation** validation across different market conditions
- **Sector-specific insights** verification

## Key Testing Patterns Used

1. **Parameterized Testing**: Multiple test cases with different inputs
2. **Edge Case Testing**: Boundary values, insufficient data, zero values
3. **Integration Testing**: Context application in explanation generation
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Handling missing/invalid inputs
5. **Data Generation**: Synthetic price data for different market conditions

## Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 85 (up from 57)
- **New Tests**: 28
- **Pass Rate**: 100%
- **Execution Time**: ~370ms

## Files Modified
1. `src/lib/technical-analysis/__tests__/explanations.test.ts` - Added 28 new test cases

## Next Steps
The imports added to `StockDashboard.tsx` are not yet being used. When they are integrated:
1. Add integration tests for `TechnicalIndicatorExplanations` component usage
2. Test the market context inference in the dashboard context
3. Verify proper data flow from dashboard to explanation components
4. Test error handling when market context cannot be inferred

## Notes
- All tests follow the existing test structure and patterns
- Tests use Vitest framework consistent with the project
- Mock data generation ensures reproducible test results
- Tests validate both happy paths and error conditions
