### 3. Volatile Market Scenario Integration
Tests high-volatility market handling with overbought indicators. Verifies:
- High volatility detection
- Position sizing warnings
- Stop-loss guidance
- Consistent risk warnings across all explanations

### 4. Sideways Market Scenario Integration
Tests range-bound market with neutral signals. Verifies:
- Sideways market detection
- Range-trading guidance
- Neutral sentiment classification
- Appropriate advice for no-trend conditions

### 5. Small-Cap Stock Scenario Integration
Tests small-cap specific guidance across multiple sectors (Technology, Healthcare, Energy). Verifies:
- Small-cap categorization (< $2B market cap)
- Volatility warnings for small-caps
- Limit order recommendations
- Sector-specific insights

### 6. Mid-Cap Stock Scenario Integration
Tests balanced guidance for mid-cap stocks. Verifies:
- Mid-cap categorization ($2B - $10B)
- Balance of growth and stability messaging
- Institutional interest monitoring advice
- Financial sector insights

### 7. Complete Indicator Suite Integration
Tests all 8 supported indicators simultaneously:
- RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic
- Williams %R, ADX, OBV, SMA

Verifies comprehensive explanation generation and proper structure for all indicators.

### 8. Contextual Adaptation Accuracy
Tests explanation adaptation based on:
- **Market Conditions**: Bull, bear, sideways
- **Volatility Levels**: Low, medium, high

Verifies condition-specific text and guidance are properly applied.

### 9. Real-World Edge Cases
Tests handling of:
- Extreme RSI values (5.0, 95.0)
- Volume indicator divergences
- Insufficient price data (< 20 days)

Verifies graceful degradation and fallback behavior.

### 10. Cross-Indicator Consistency
Tests that market context is consistently applied across all indicators. Verifies:
- Same market condition referenced in all explanations
- Consistent market cap guidance
- Consistent sector insights
- Similar risk assessments for similar conditions

### 11. Performance Integration
Tests performance with realistic data volumes:
- 20 indicators processed simultaneously
- Execution time < 50ms
- Conflict detection with mixed signals
- Efficient explanation generation

## Integration with Existing Tests

### Unit Tests (85 tests)
- `src/lib/technical-analysis/__tests__/explanations.test.ts`
- All unit tests continue to pass
- Focus on individual function behavior

### Integration Tests (15 tests)
- `src/lib/technical-analysis/__tests__/explanations.integration.test.ts`
- Focus on end-to-end workflows
- Realistic market scenarios
- Cross-component interactions

## Test Data Generation

### Realistic Price Data Scenarios
The tests use a sophisticated price data generator that creates realistic market conditions:

```typescript
createRealisticPriceData(scenario: 'bull' | 'bear' | 'sideways' | 'volatile')
```

- **Bull**: Steady uptrend with minor pullbacks
- **Bear**: Steady downtrend with minor bounces
- **Sideways**: Range-bound with small fluctuations
- **Volatile**: High volatility with large swings

## Requirements Coverage

✅ **6.1**: Plain language explanations (4-5 sentences) - TESTED
✅ **6.2**: Contextual tailoring to stock conditions - TESTED
✅ **6.3**: Organized in expandable sections - TESTED (component level)
✅ **6.4**: Dynamic updates with value changes - TESTED
✅ **6.5**: Practical guidance and actions - TESTED
✅ **6.6**: Conflicting signal explanations - TESTED

### Additional Coverage
