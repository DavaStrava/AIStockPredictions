# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Stock Prediction platform currently has a narrow layout that doesn't effectively utilize larger screen real estate, resulting in poor user experience on desktop and tablet devices. This feature will optimize the responsive design to provide better space utilization, improved readability, and enhanced user experience across all screen sizes while maintaining the existing functionality and visual hierarchy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with a large desktop monitor, I want the application to utilize the full width of my screen, so that I can view more information at once and have a better overall experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is viewed on screens wider than 1024px THEN the layout SHALL expand to utilize at least 90% of the available screen width
2. WHEN the application is viewed on screens wider than 1440px THEN the content SHALL be distributed across multiple columns or sections to prevent excessive horizontal scrolling
3. WHEN the layout expands THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact and accessible
4. WHEN the layout expands THEN the visual hierarchy and design consistency SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing stock data and charts, I want the components to be properly sized and spaced on larger screens, so that I can easily read and analyze the information without strain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN stock prediction cards are displayed on larger screens THEN they SHALL be arranged in a responsive grid that utilizes available horizontal space
2. WHEN charts and graphs are displayed THEN they SHALL scale appropriately to fill their containers while maintaining aspect ratios
3. WHEN text content is displayed THEN font sizes and line heights SHALL be optimized for readability on larger screens
4. WHEN the market indices sidebar is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain appropriate proportions relative to the main content area

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the application to remain fully responsive, so that I have a consistent and optimal experience regardless of my screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is viewed on mobile devices (< 768px) THEN the current mobile-optimized layout SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN the application is viewed on tablet devices (768px - 1024px) THEN the layout SHALL provide an intermediate responsive experience
3. WHEN transitioning between screen sizes THEN the layout SHALL adapt smoothly without breaking or causing horizontal scrolling
4. WHEN the layout adapts THEN all interactive elements SHALL remain accessible and properly sized for touch or mouse interaction

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user analyzing multiple stocks simultaneously, I want to see more stock cards and information on larger screens, so that I can compare and analyze more data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing stock prediction cards on screens wider than 1024px THEN the system SHALL display more cards per row (minimum 3-4 cards)
2. WHEN viewing detailed analysis sections THEN they SHALL be arranged to minimize vertical scrolling on larger screens
3. WHEN multiple data sections are present THEN they SHALL be organized in a logical grid or column layout
4. WHEN the layout changes THEN the loading states and error handling SHALL work correctly across all responsive breakpoints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user making investment decisions, I want to easily understand and act on the stock information presented on larger screens, so that I can make more informed and confident trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing stock data on larger screens THEN the system SHALL display actionable insights prominently (buy/sell/hold recommendations, key price targets, risk indicators)
2. WHEN technical analysis data is shown THEN it SHALL be presented with clear visual indicators and plain-language explanations of what the data means for investment decisions
3. WHEN multiple data points are displayed THEN they SHALL be organized with clear visual hierarchy showing the most critical information first (current price, trend direction, key support/resistance levels)
4. WHEN AI insights are available THEN they SHALL be displayed in dedicated, easily scannable sections with bullet points or numbered action items
5. WHEN performance metrics are shown THEN they SHALL include contextual information (e.g., "RSI of 75 suggests stock may be overbought - consider waiting for pullback")
6. WHEN viewing stock predictions THEN the system SHALL display confidence levels, timeframes, and specific price targets in an easily digestible format

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a novice investor learning about technical analysis, I want detailed, easy-to-understand explanations of technical indicators tailored to current market conditions, so that I can learn while making informed investment decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN technical indicators are displayed (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.) THEN each indicator SHALL include a 4-5 sentence explanation written in plain language for novice investors
2. WHEN indicator explanations are shown THEN they SHALL be contextually tailored to the current stock's specific conditions and market environment (e.g., "Tesla's RSI of 68 indicates strong momentum but approaching overbought territory, which historically has led to short-term pullbacks in growth stocks during volatile markets")
3. WHEN multiple technical indicators are present THEN their explanations SHALL be organized in expandable sections or dedicated explanation panels that don't clutter the main view
4. WHEN indicator values change THEN the explanations SHALL update to reflect the new conditions and their implications for the specific stock
5. WHEN explanations are provided THEN they SHALL include practical guidance on what actions or considerations the indicator suggests (e.g., "Consider waiting for RSI to drop below 50 before entering a position" or "This MACD crossover suggests potential upward momentum - monitor for confirmation over next 2-3 trading days")
6. WHEN technical indicators show conflicting signals THEN the system SHALL explain the contradiction and provide guidance on how to interpret mixed signals for this specific stock and market context
