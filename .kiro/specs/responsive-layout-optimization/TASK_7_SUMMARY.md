### 7.2 Add Smooth Responsive Transitions ✅
**Requirements: 3.3, 4.4**

#### Implementation
- Created `responsive-transitions.css` with comprehensive transition rules
- Imported CSS in main layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Implemented smooth transitions for:
  - Container width and padding changes
  - Grid column count adjustments
  - Sidebar appearance/disappearance
  - Typography size changes
  - Flexbox layout changes

#### Key Features
- **Horizontal Scroll Prevention**
  - `overflow-x: hidden` on html and body
  - `max-width: 100%` on all elements
  - Proper box-sizing for all containers
  - Text overflow handling with word-wrap

- **Smooth Transitions**
  - 0.3s ease-in-out for layout changes
  - 0.2s for typography changes
  - Faster transitions on mobile (0.2s)
  - Slower transitions for large screens (0.4s)

- **Breakpoint-Specific Optimizations**
  - Mobile: Faster transitions (0.2s)
  - Tablet: Standard transitions (0.3s)
  - Desktop: Smooth sidebar transitions (0.4s)
  - Large Desktop: Optimized for multi-column changes

- **Accessibility**
  - Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
  - Disables transitions for users who prefer reduced motion
  - Maintains accessibility during transitions

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - `will-change` hints for desktop devices
  - Touch device optimizations
  - Grid reflow optimization
  - Layout shift prevention

#### Test Results
- ✅ 25/25 tests passing
- Horizontal scroll prevention verified
- Layout adaptation tested across breakpoints
- Smooth transitions confirmed

### 7.3 Implement Responsive Error Handling ✅
**Requirements: 3.3, 4.4**

#### Implementation
- Created `ResponsiveLayoutErrorBoundary` component
- Integrated error boundary in main page layout
- Implemented graceful degradation to mobile layout
- Added error type detection (layout, data, rendering)
- Created `useResponsiveErrorBoundary` hook for functional components

#### Key Features
- **Error Catching**
  - Catches all errors in responsive components
  - Prevents app crashes from layout failures
  - Maintains app stability during errors

- **Error Type Detection**
  - Layout errors (grid, flex, layout keywords)
  - Data errors (undefined, null keywords)
  - Rendering errors (component, render keywords)
  - Unknown error fallback

- **Graceful Degradation**
  - Automatically falls back to mobile layout
  - Maintains functionality during errors
  - Provides clear user guidance
  - Shows recovery options

- **Fallback UI**
  - Mobile-first layout (max-w-md)
  - Clear error messaging
  - "Try Again" button for recovery
  - "Reload Page" button for full reset
  - Troubleshooting steps for users
  - Development mode error details

- **Developer Experience**
  - Detailed error information in development
  - Error stack traces
  - Component stack traces
  - Error type classification
  - Console logging for debugging

- **Custom Fallback Support**
  - Optional custom fallback component
  - Error callback for custom handling
  - Flexible error recovery strategies

#### Test Results
- ✅ 26/26 tests passing
- Error catching verified for all error types
- Fallback UI tested comprehensively
- Recovery mechanisms validated
- Hook functionality confirmed
